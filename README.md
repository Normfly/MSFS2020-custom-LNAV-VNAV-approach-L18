L18 GPS 18 (LNAV/VNAV)

This is a custom approach for MSFS2020. Just place the unzipped folder in your MSFS2020 Community folder. 

Steam edition, C:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Community\

The project zip has all the files and folders to modify and use.

The other zip is the end result to place in the community folder. (the json and .bgl files)
